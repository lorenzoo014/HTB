I know I made mistakes, I lost the train ticket, I'm so sorry.
I would do everything to see you one more time.
I painted you something.
I even stole the source code from the train station in order to find you.
My memories of you are fading and there are only 6 birds left but
I hope that we'll meet again.

Disclaimer: forologia.jpg is just something I painted for the story, don't fall
in the rabbit hole of stego stuff.
